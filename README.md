# M3-Markov-Distinction
Title: The Markov Modern Abstract Artist

NOTE: In order to run this program you must have graphics.py installed in your Python library. This can be downloaded using pip
or simply saved inside of your Python folder. This program also requires your system to have numpy installed which can similarly be downloaded and installed using pip.  

Directions:
1. Run the program.
2. input valid integer commands for window height, width, and number of shapes you would like to use.
3. if the system receives an invalid input it will terminate and require you to run again.
4. To exit out of the drawing, simply click on the portrait. 

How it Works:
The program utilizes two different Markov Transition Matrices to probabilistically select colors and shapes to display on a window of your preferred size. The transition matrices contain arbitrary probabilities that result in making colorful and unique pieces of art every time the program is run. The list of shapes include: rectangles, circles, ovals, triangles, and hexagons. The list of colors include: Red, yellow, blue, green, cyan, pink, orange, purple, black, and white.

Personal Meaning:
This system is personally meaningful to me because it represents my current feelings upon entering this class. I know I have the basic skills I need to excel, but there is trepidation, fear, and confusion all melded together in my mind as I begin the journey through this course. The artwork that is created in this system is excellent at displaying these feelings because it is an abstract mess of confusing shapes and colors that are never permenant. You can run the program countless times and each time you will end up with a different result of mixed colors and shapes. The true beauty behind the system, however, is the unpredictability. Sometimes the artwork created is beautiful and makes sense the way the shapes and colors fit together. Other times, the artwork is bad and the shapes and colors do not seem to fit together well. I think the unbeautiful pieces are just as important as the beautiful ones because they represent mistakes that can be made along the way that still lend themselves to improved learning. 

The Challenge of this project:
Working with a brand new module, graphics.py, presented a host of challenges for me. The extent of my graphics experience with python was using Turtle in the "Intro to CS" course as a first year. This project challenged me to delve into the documentation on graphics.py and learn how to use different colors, shapes, and create windows that actually display the art on your screen. This was a new experience for me, and one that I truly enjoyed. Further challenges included working with command line inputs, and dealing with bad/incorrect inputs. I think this is an extremely useful skill to work on and one that I want to improve on a lot. The thing that put me most out of my comfort zone was trying to understand how I can actually create a piece of meaningful art without the action of drawing or painting myself. It is a very different creative process to construct an artist that is able to make something creative and makes me feel like I am playing god in a sense. The importance of this challenge, though, was learning that I am able to produce ideas that I find creative by utilizing common python tools. Before working on this project I had a very limited understanding of how a computer could create art, but now I feel like I at least have a foundation on how to go forward from here. The next steps for me will be exploring more tools in the graphics.py module and to understand other ways that visual art can be created using Markov Chains and coding tools. 

Is This System Creative?:
I find this question very difficult to answer. I think I would say it is creative in the sense that any intelligent human could generate creative thoughts by looking at its result. In this sense it is no different than many other pieces of abstract art. I struggle to say it is fully creative as the system is not actually thinking about the meaning that I have attributed to the colors and the shapes. I had intentionality and creativity in creating a system that would demonstrate my feelings, but the system itself is just processing numbers and probabilities that in reality have no actual creative meaning. This is a very difficult philosophical question to answer, but ultimately I think it can be considered creative because of the ability it has to inspire thoughts in the minds of intelligent minds.
